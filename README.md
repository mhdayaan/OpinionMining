## Introduction

Opinion Mining on Product Reviews is a project that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to extract opinions and sentiments from product reviews. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models using libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhdayaan/OpinionMining
cd OpinionMining
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for modeling, including text cleaning, tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatization.

2. **Model Training**: Train various machine learning and deep learning models, including LSTM networks, for sentiment analysis.

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

4. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to predict sentiments on new product reviews.

5. **Flask Application**: Run the Flask application to interact with the opinion mining model.

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Open your web browser and visit** [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to interact with the Opinion Mining application.
